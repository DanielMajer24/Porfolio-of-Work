# Porfolio-of-Work
A list of my completed projects over the last 2 and a half years. 

# [Project 1: Supervised Classification Task](https://danielmajer24.github.io/Wine-Classification/)

The purpose of this report was to identify the patterns present in the datset by performing principal component analysis and accurately classify the wine type of the dataset using a number of supervised classification techniques.

The exploratory and classification techniques I used included:
- Principal Component Analysis (Exploratory Analysis)
- Naive Bayes
- Linear Discriminant Analysis
- Quadratic Discriminant Analysis
- k Nearest Neighbour Cluster

This measured accuracy, recall, precision and F1 statistic to compare the respective models.

This project and code can be found [here](https://github.com/DanielMajer24/Wine-Classification). 

# [Project 2: Comparing Machine Learning algorithms to a Neural Net](https://danielmajer24.github.io/Comparing-a-VNN-to-SVM/)

The purpose of this project was to implement a Vanilla Neural Network (VNN) and compare it to a selected machine learning (ML) algorithm on a supplied time series dataset to predict the Australiaâ€™s unemployment rate.

The techniques I used included:
- VNN with 3 hidden layers and a Relu activation
- Random Forest ML algorithm
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
