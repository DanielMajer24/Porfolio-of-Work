# Daniel Majer Portfolio
A list of my completed projects over the last 2 and a half years. 

# Machine Learning Projects
## [Project 1: Supervised Classification Task](https://danielmajer24.github.io/Wine-Classification/)
### Project Overview:

The purpose of this report was to identify the patterns present in the datset by performing principal component analysis and accurately classify the wine type of the dataset using a number of supervised classification techniques.

Principal Component Analysis was used for exploratory analysis and to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset.

The classification techniques I used included:
- Naive Bayes
- Linear Discriminant Analysis
- Quadratic Discriminant Analysis
- k Nearest Neighbour Cluster

This measured accuracy, error, precision, recall, F1 statistic and AUC to compare the respective models.

This project was done in R and code can be found [here](https://github.com/DanielMajer24/Wine-Classification). 

## [Project 2: Comparing Machine Learning algorithms to a Neural Net](https://danielmajer24.github.io/Comparing-a-VNN-to-SVM/)
### Project Overview:

The purpose of this project was to implement a Vanilla Neural Network (VNN) and compare it to a selected machine learning (ML) algorithm on a supplied time series dataset to predict the Australiaâ€™s unemployment rate.

The techniques I used included:
- Random Forest and Support Vector Machine (SVM) ML algorithm

- VNN with 3 hidden layers and a Relu activation

The final ML model in the comparison with the VNN was the SVM algorithm. The metrics used for the comparison include RSME, RSquared and Mean Absolute Error.

This project was done in R and code can be found [here](https://github.com/DanielMajer24/Comparing-a-VNN-to-SVM). 

## [Project 3: Suport Vector Machines and XGBoost Machine Learning Algorithms](https://danielmajer24.github.io/SVM-Analysis/)
### Project Overview: 

This project was broken up into two parts: 

1) manually implment the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algortihm using user-defined functions

2) Compared the performance between SVM and a selected ML algorithm

The techniques I used included:
- successfully applied SVM using user defined functions

- implemented SVM and XGBoost algothirms on a supervised classfication task using Credit Default Data
These algorithms were compared using accuracy, error, precision, recall, F1 statistic and AUC.
