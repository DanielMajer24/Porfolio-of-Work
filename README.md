# Daniel Majer Portfolio
A list of my completed projects over the last 2 and a half years. 

# Machine Learning Projects
## [Project 1: Supervised Classification Task](https://danielmajer24.github.io/Wine-Classification/)
### Project Overview:

The purpose of this report was to identify the patterns present in the datset by performing principal component analysis and accurately classify the wine type of the dataset using a number of supervised classification techniques.

The exploratory and classification techniques I used included:
- Principal Component Analysis (Exploratory Analysis)
- Naive Bayes
- Linear Discriminant Analysis
- Quadratic Discriminant Analysis
- k Nearest Neighbour Cluster

This measured accuracy, recall, precision and F1 statistic to compare the respective models.

This project was done in R and code can be found [here](https://github.com/DanielMajer24/Wine-Classification). 

## [Project 2: Comparing Machine Learning algorithms to a Neural Net](https://danielmajer24.github.io/Comparing-a-VNN-to-SVM/)
### Project Overview:

The purpose of this project was to implement a Vanilla Neural Network (VNN) and compare it to a selected machine learning (ML) algorithm on a supplied time series dataset to predict the Australiaâ€™s unemployment rate.

The techniques I used included:
- VNN with 3 hidden layers and a Relu activation
- Random Forest ML algorithm
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

This project was done in R and code can be found [here](https://github.com/DanielMajer24/Comparing-a-VNN-to-SVM). 

## [Project 3: Suport Vector Machines and XGBoost Machine Learning Algorithms](https://danielmajer24.github.io/SVM-Analysis/)
### Project Overview: 

This project was broken up into two parts: 

1) manually implment the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algortihm using user-defined functions
2) Compared the performance between SVM and a selected ML algorithm

The techniques I used included:
- successfully applied SVM using user defined functions
- implemented SVM and XGBoost algothirms on a supervised classfication task using Credit Default Data

This project was done in R code for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/DanielMajer24/SVM-Analysis)
